        <h2>What is Yuru-chara?</h2>
          <p>Yuru-chara are the characters that are instantly
          recognized as a form of a region’s special product, culture
          , history or other outstanding feature, and they’re
          considered familiar figures and widely loved. Whenever
          these characters appear live (with people wearing full-size
          character costumes to animate them) at tourist sites or
          special events, they’re instantly surrounded by crowds
          surging forward and exclaiming “kawaii!” (how cute!) and
          vying to have their pictures taken with the characters.
          The mascot characters also decorate a wide range of
          products for sale, from stationery items to souvenir
          cookies, which make popular gifts.</p><!-- did not use
          articles to separate content because it wasn't needed for

        <h2>Arukuma</h2>
          <p>Arukuma is a green bear that wanders around, fitting as
          his name means “walking bear,” who collects hats. Each hat
          he collects represents one of Nagano’s specialities like
          apples, chestnuts, persimmons, mushrooms, lettuce, soba and
          wine. He was created to represent Nagano’s apple orchids,
          since he wears an apple hat most of the time.</p>
