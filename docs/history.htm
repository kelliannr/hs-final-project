        <p>The Nagano Prefecture is located in the former Shinano
        Province and has developed from the Nara period. Nagano city
        was formerly known as Zenkõji city and is the capital of the
        prefecture. The city grew up around the Zenkō Temple, which
        was founded in the 7th century. Nagano later developed as a
        market town and post station along the Hokkoku Road. It is
        now an important commercial center with food-processing,
        electrical machinery, and printing and publishing industries.
        Nagano is also a cultural and educational center and is the
        site of Shinshū University. In 1876, Chikuma and Nagano
        merged to form the Nagano Prefecture. The high speed
        transportation network was improved with the opening of
        Hokuriku Super Express system and the completion of the
        expressways. Nagano city hosted the 1998 Winter Olympic Games
        . The image to the right shows the Zenkō Temple, where Nagano
        city was built around.</p>
