        <p>Nagano is one of the coldest regions in Japan with an
           average daily high temperature of only 18℃. It is cold,
           wet and a few beautiful summer months are also happening
           during a year. The best time of year to visit Nagano is
           May through September if you want good weather with
           comfortable temperatures. The wettest month is December,
           the driest is May, the warmest is August, and the coolest
           is March, so going in between will give the ideal
           experience. Nagano gets an annual average of about 2,000
           hours of sun. There is a high rate of clear and cloudless
           skies and relatively low humidity, with an average
