        <h2>Matsushiro Samurai School</h2>
          <p>The Matsushiro Samurai School was built in 1853 by
             Sanada Yukinori, who was the 9th leader of the
             Matsushiro Clan. The Sanada family placed great
             importance in educating samurai and their children, in
             both literary (reading, writing and arithmetic) and
             military (martial arts, tactics, etc.) which led to the
             building of this school. The school disbanded during the
             Meiji Restoration (1868) and the facility is used as
             Matsushiro Elementary. It was designated as a national
             historical site in 1953, it was the only school in Japan
             that retains its original form and structure. Click the
